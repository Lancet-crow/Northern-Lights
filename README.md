# Northern-Lights
Hello, stranger! I am Lancet_, the developer of this little mod based on Nordic food. My main goal is to almost seamlessly integrate Nordic culture into Farmer's Delight.

I've already added:
- Heather. Can be found in Meadow biome in small patches, pretty rare. Drops itself.
- Heather Honey Bottle. Crafts in Cooking Pot from Farmer's Delight with Honey Bottle, Heather and Sugar. Has more saturation and nutrition than regular Honey Bottle. Can be recycled to 5 Sugar through Crafting Table.
- Wild Oat. Can be found in Meadow biome, same as Heather, but more common. Drops Oat Seeds.
- Oat and Oat Dough(analog of Wheat Dough from Farmer's Delight). Oat is still useless aside this recipe(of course will be fixed in the future).

**My plans for the future:**
- Adding new plants: Lingonberry, Cranberry
- Adding new drinks: Heather Ale, Fruit Wine, Mead, Cranberry Juice
- Adding new salads: Beetroot Salad, Potato Salad, Salmon Salad
- Adding new sweets: Carrot Pie, Oat Cookie, Trollkrem, Lingonberry Jam

**This is not a full list, it can and will be expanded. See you soon on Modrinth!**
