# Northern Lights
Hello, stranger! I am Lancet_, the developer of this little mod based on Nordic food. My main goal is to almost seamlessly integrate Nordic culture into Farmer's Delight.

I've already added:
- Heather(Spawns in Meadow biome, pretty rare)
- Heather Honey Bottle(craftable in Cooking Pot with Honey Bottle, Heather and Sugar, can be recycled to Sugar through Crafting Table)
  
**My plans for the future:**
- Adding new plants: Oat, Lingonberry, Cranberry
- Adding new drinks: Heather Ale, Fruit Wine, Mead, Cranberry Juice
- Adding new salads: Beetroot Salad, Potato Salad, Salmon Salad
- Adding new sweets: Carrot Pie, Oat Cookie, Trollkrem, Lingonberry Jam
  
**This is not a full list, it can and will be expanded. See you soon on Modrinth!**
